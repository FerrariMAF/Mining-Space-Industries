secmission_3_txt=GLaDOS: "I don't know why you abandoned Wheatley in those cold wrecks of the ship, I know he's not reliable, and he deserves it, but I think it could help retrieving the data to build the most interesting piece of science, the Portal Gun! I can try to reanimate it if you take me there with a Construction Robot. I'm going to use the parts of that disposable robot to fix Wheatley."
secmission_3_success=GLaDOS: "I did it, I got the data back for the Portal Gun technology! Ahhh, Wheatley is operating normally." Wheatley: "Hello, hello, thank you for reanimating me! Are we going to contribute to science?"

secmission_4=Bring Wheatley + 20 advanced circuits to the wreck of the SHIP (starting area).
secmission_4_txt=So let's go testing? But where are those cubes? Without the cubes the test chambers do not have the same results. The plans for assembling the cubes were on the spaceship's computer memory. Were you able to recover it? NO!?? Take me to one of the first wreckage. I will try to recover the data from the computer. But I'm going to need a pen drive. "
secmission_4_success=Wheatley: Here's the assembly plan for the cubes, now we can start our tests for science!"
secmission_4_fail=Wheatley: "Oops! I think I broke something !! Sorry!"


secmission_6=Take 20 repair kits to the wreckage of the ship's military cargo.
secmission_6_txt=Look at that! Our radars found more wreckage of the ship! It seems to be what's left of the military compartment. There may be something useful there, if we can get to it in time ... That seems to be about to explode. Fast! Take 20 repair kits to open the cargo bay.

secmission_8_success=Freeman: "Here it is! I have successfully recovered the data for Omega Drill technology! To the lab!

secmission_9=Freeman can maximize the production of Processing Units by researching the "Maximize Production" technology.
secmission_9_txt=Freeman: Listen to me! I'm pretty sure that if we study the forces of this planet more, we can find sectors where we can maximize the production of resources. I have a theory about Processing Units. I have made available the "Maximize production" technology. Once researched, we will know where to produce more efficiently.
secmission_9B_txt=Freeman: "Well, I'm sure I've found the right place to produce Processing Units. It is marked on the map, but ATTENTION !! This overpower production can only be executed there or our machines would be very unstable. And DO NOT take logistic robots to that area!

secmission_10=We are under attack! Kill that giant beast that's firing our base! (location marked on the map)
secmission_10_txt=ALERT! See that huge ball of fire coming our way! We're being attacked! Our radars detected that the attack came from a huge fire-launching worm. Military, get ready! Kill that worm and eliminate the threat. The location is marked on the map.
secmission_10V_txt=That's all right, military! That huge fire-spitting worm is gone. It will be necessary to repair the damage, but we are safe, for now. Great work!

mission_1_1=Survived, that's all that matters! 
mission_1_1_txt=Landing was a tragedy. Upon reaching the atmosphere, felt that something wasn't going well. Extreme vibration caused serious damage to the ship. One of the rockets leaked fuel and exploded. The cabin crew managed to eject in escape pods before the ship exploded. Probably all the tools and technologies were destroyed in the crash. But maybe we can still use the some energy fro the shipwreck
mission_1_2=Set up a perimeter and build a radar to map the area.
mission_1_2_txt=All the technology, equipment and part of the crew are lost. No communication with the space fleet, you will be considered dead and abandoned in this hostile planet. Military, check the perimeter. Engineers, build a base and try to reestablish communication with radars. It is possible that other important parts of the Ship are out there.

mission_1_2A_txt=Great! We are expanding the perimeter very well. Our radars continue to map the planet. But be careful! Radars indicate abnormal movement of these bitters. Be prepared.

mission_1_2F=Scanned this area. Other parts of the spaceship must be further away. Keep searching.
mission_1_2F_txt=Good work, engineers! At least the closest area has already been mapped. Unfortunately we have not yet found one of the most important parts of the ship, which brought our technology and all artificial intelligence ...

mission_1_3=Find the ship wreck where the robotic core is.
mission_1_3_txt=It will be impossible to develop robotics technology from scratch. It is crucial to recover the robotic core unit in the wreckage of the ship where important plans are stored. Researching scan technology may help finding it.
mission_1_4=Rescue GLaDOS and research Robotics
mission_1_4_txt=Finally! Found the location of the wreckage of the ship. The processing core should be there. What's left of GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) must be brought to the laboratories to be used in the robotics program. The location is marked on the map. Go rescue it! Protect it at all costs! It is the only way to research robotics.
mission_1_5=GLaDOS: Managed to extract from GlaDOS the information.
mission_1_5_txt=Managed to extract from GlaDOS the information needed to create robots. Its sarcastic personality was installed on the system. Keep moving and fast. With contact lost,  the space fleet will leave the system without you.

We need to investigate this phenomenon by researching the Smoke Analysis in the Atmosphere technology as soon as possible.
mission_3_0_2=The smoke is biological and will bring total darkness! Search "Origin of Biological Smoke".
mission_3_0_2_txt=We have finished the analysis of the dense smoke and the result is worrying. The smoke has a biological origin and is covering the entire atmosphere of the planet very quickly. In a short time the planet will be overwhelmed by total darkness! We believe the aliens have evolved and are doing this to attack us in the dark and damage our machines. Our radars could detect the origin of the emissions, if we investigate the "Origin of Biological Smoke" Technology. Scientists! This is our priority! Military, prepare for the worst! We have only a few days until total darkness.
mission_3_0_2_smoke=Attention! Smoke has already covered the entire planet. No light can cross. We are in total darkness, and our robots have slowed down. We need to eliminate the source of these emissions with URGENCY!
